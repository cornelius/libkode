### libkode

This repository contains C++/Qt code mainly for C++ code generation and XML/XSD parsing.

The code was originally part of the [kode](https://github.com/cornelius/kode) and the [KDSOAP](https://github.com/KDAB/KDSoap) project.

Later we moved it to a separate repository to ease the developent between the two projects.

#### Code generation

The goal of these codes to ease generation of C++ code from Qt based applications.

The code generator is designed to support generating C++11 and onwards compliant code.

#### Projects using this code

* [kode](https://github.com/cornelius/kode) - Qt based XML meta programming tool
* [KDSOAP](https://github.com/KDAB/KDSoap) - A Qt-based client-side and server-side SOAP component 
* [nut-codegen](https://github.com/martonmiklos/nut_codegen) - code generator for the [Nut ORM](https://github.com/HamedMasafi/Nut)

If you would like to get your public project using libkode listed here please let us know in an [issue](https://github.com/cornelius/libkode/issues).
